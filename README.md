# Pill Buddy
## About
- Created by a team of 4 in just 10 hours, from idea to finished product, during HackSC (Nov 2024).
- Received Honorable Mention Award.

## What it does
- Helps elderly patients identify their medications through simple voice and/or text inputs.
- Assists pharmacy staffs, pharmacy techs, and pharmacists shortlist the pills patient was talking about.

## Inspiration
A former pharmacy technician on our team noticed that many elderly patients, especially those on multiple medications, struggle to identify their pills and often rely on visual appearance. Since theyâ€™re not very tech-savvy, they frequently call the pharmacy, requiring time-consuming searches by pharmacists. This inspired us to develop an AI solution to quickly narrow down potential pills based on patients' descriptions, streamlining the process.

Please bear with me if my voice sounded drowsy, that's because I was. Try working 10 hours intensively and that's what you got. That being said, I enjoyed the whole process :)
